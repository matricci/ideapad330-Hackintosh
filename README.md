# Lenovo Ideapad 330 15Kib Hackintosh

## My specs: 
* Core I5 8250u - Intel Graphics 620 
* RAM 8 Gb - DDR4 
* Full HD display - I did a screen swap :)
* Elan touchpad 
* Tp-Link Nano

## What doesn't work:
* Stock Wifi card - but bluetooth works!

## Workarounds: 
* The `Jack Fix` script is to fix glichty audio when using the Headphone jack, it has be excecuted every time you plug a headphone

## Note:
* Trackpad gestures works out of the box, thanks to the VodooI2CELAN kext
